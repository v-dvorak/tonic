    Assigns given notes to given measures and computes their pitches.
    The method modifies given list of measures in place.
    Note are assigned to measures based on distance between their centers and the upper assignment limit (UAL).

    If the note's distance from the closest measure is larger than UAL, the note is dropped from further processing.

    UAL is computed as: `np.mean(heights of all measures) * ual_factor`

    For example, `ual_factor` set to 1.5 means that notes that are
    "one measure height above" and "one measure height below" are considered valid.

    and the average distance between staff lines in that particular measure.
